I ended up just saving the output as a csv and using that to display, But just in case you wanted to run the model, i uploaded the model to HF as well that way you could just skip the training.
Overall i believe the model is good, but it struggles to classify all caps tweets, which im not sure why since I used the uncased version for the model. other than that its fairly accurate. I was unsure what to put on the landing site other than the model and space so I apologize if thats not up to par.
