[HF SPACE LINK HERE](https://huggingface.co/spaces/thotranexe/toxicity)
the hugging face space works it just takes a very long time to train the model due to limited space. Ideally i would like to upload the PT file to skip the traing in order to display what was asked. the code itself works and take 30 minutes to run on a google colab. due to the main file beng a py I wasnt able to save any inputs. If i could have any suggestions to reduce the run time that would be greatly appreciated.
