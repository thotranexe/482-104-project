[HF SPACE LINK HERE](https://huggingface.co/spaces/thotranexe/milestone2)
I followed the tutorial posted and created a [seperate repo](https://github.com/thotranexe/milestone2) for this milestone however all the code is stil was written and copy pasted on this branch just in case. I understand that I probably shouldve just used this branch as the repo to deploy the HF spaces from. In the future I will use this repo to deply from. 

The model I used was the [twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-model](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment?text=T%27estimo%21) and i just tweaked it so that it would print on streamlits web app instead.
