### [HF space here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/thotranexe/toxicity)

##### The code works it just takes a very long while to load on the hugging face due to the computing limations imposed by the space. I wanted to save the model to load it in hugging face but file was too large for git. I would greatly appreciate any reccomendations to bypass this issue. Below is attached proof that the code is functional if you dont want to wait 7+ hours for the HF spacce to finish training the model :)
